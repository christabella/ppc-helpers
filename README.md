get-load
--------

Run on kosh, shows all Maari-A/C computers with no users,
ordered by their CPU load. Example:

    ppc-helpers/get-load

If you want to see all computers and their users, try:

    ppc-helpers/get-load-all

If you have difficulties accessing Maari computers from kosh,
try to renew your Kerberos tickets first:

    kinit
